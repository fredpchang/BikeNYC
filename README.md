# BikeNYC

Developed as a final project for UPenn’s CIT-591: Introduction to Software Engineering class. This Java application takes in the user’s location and finds the closest Citibike station with real-time information such as number of bikes available as well as a list of recommended attractions nearby. All this is made possible by utilizing Google Geocoding API, Foursquare API, as well as CitiBike API.
